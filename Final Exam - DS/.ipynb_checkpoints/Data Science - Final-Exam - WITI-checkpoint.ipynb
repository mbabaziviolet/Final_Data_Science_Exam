    "# Background on Python, iPython, Jupyter and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level general purpose programming language named after a [British comedy troup](https://www.youtube.com/user/MontyPython), created by a [Dutch programmer as a hobby project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and maintained by an international group of friendly but opinionated python enthusiasts (`import this!`). Until June 2018, Guido van Rossum was the [Benevolent dictator for life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) for the Python language, now decisions are made jointly by the Python Steering Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is popular for data science because it's powerful, fast, plays well with others, runs everywhere, is easy to learn, highly readable, and open. Because it's general purpose it can be used for full-stack development. It's got a growing list of useful libraries for scientitic programming, data manipulation, data analysis. (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Pybrain, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "[iPython](http://ipython.org/) is an enhanced, interactive python interpreter started as a grad school project by [Fernando Perez](http://fperez.org/). iPython (jupyter) notebooks allow you to run a multi-language (Python, R, Julia, Markdown, LaTex, etc) interpreter in your browser to create rich, portable, and sharable code documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a libary created by [Wes McKinney](http://blog.wesmckinney.com/) that introduces the R-like dataframe object to Python and makes working with data in Python a lot easier. It's also a lot more efficient than the R dataframe and pretty much makes Python superior to R in every imaginable way (except for ggplot 2). \n",

Print a view of first 10 lines of the dataset. Next we will isolate the data we want to focus our attention on by creating a new DataFrame from the source, and by applying a few filters against it. We want to isolate the records where all the following conditions are true. First the Daily Difference count is greater than zero. Next the Case Type should be Confirmed. Finally, the Country_Region should be only Italy: Check whether the results are sorted by cases & ascending order to  well and accordingly, write the command to accomplish it:\n",

    "A reduce repeatedly applies a given operation to the elements of an array until only a single result remains.\n",

    "For example, calling ``reduce`` on the ``add`` ufunc returns the sum of all elements in the array: `For x = np.arange(1, 6)`\n",
